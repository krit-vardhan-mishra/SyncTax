# YouTubeMusic

YouTubeMusic is an offline-first Android music player and recommendation app that demonstrates on-device personalization and lightweight ML models. The app delivers a modern UI, background playback, and a small ensemble-based recommendation system that uses both Kotlin agents and a Python ML module (via Chaquopy).
